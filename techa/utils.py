    Return the OLS linear regression slope of `values` vs a zero-based integer index.

    Computes slope = cov(x, y) / var(x) where x = [0, 1, ..., n-1].

    Args:
        values: 1-D numpy array of floats. Must have at least 2 elements.

    Returns:
        Slope as float. Returns 0.0 for a constant series (zero variance in x = impossible,

def ols_slope_r2(values: np.ndarray) -> tuple[float, float]:

    Return (slope, R²) of the OLS linear regression of `values` vs a zero-based index.

    R² measures the fraction of variance explained by the linear trend:
      - R² < 0.3  → slope is dominated by noise; treat as informational only.
      - R² ≥ 0.7  → strong linear trend in the window.

    Args:
        values: 1-D numpy array of floats. Must have at least 2 elements.

    Returns:
        (slope, r2) as floats.
        Returns (0.0, 0.0) for series with fewer than 2 elements or zero total variance.

        >>> ols_slope_r2(np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0]))
