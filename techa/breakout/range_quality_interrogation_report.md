## Opening Statement

This file presents itself as a "foundational analytical primitive" — the kind of language used by engineers who want you to believe the foundations were carefully laid. They were not. What we have is a collection of hardcoded thresholds that were clearly eyeballed on one or two real tickers, a state machine that silently makes decisions about what constitutes a "touch" based on values that have never been validated against a distribution of real-world consolidation windows, and a Wilder-smoothing-free OLS slope being passed off as a trading signal. The code is clean-looking. That is the most dangerous kind of code. It reads like a professional wrote it. A professional *would have measured things.*

---

## The Charges

---

**Constant #1: `TOUCH_HI_THRESHOLD = 85.0` and `TOUCH_LO_THRESHOLD = 15.0`**

*What it is:* Lines 53–54. Hardcoded percentile thresholds that define whether price is "at resistance" or "at support."

*Why? (Layer 1):* Presumably these felt symmetrical and round. 85 and 15 are equidistant from 50. Someone drew a line.
*Why? (Layer 2):* Why 85 and not 80 or 90? The difference between calling something a resistance touch at 80% vs 85% changes the touch count — which feeds directly into `n_resistance_touches`, which feeds directly into the AI system prompt that drives trading decisions.
*Why? (Layer 3):* There is no reference to any empirical study, backtest, or distribution analysis of where price *actually* reverses in range-bound Italian equities. The smoke test uses *one* ticker (SCM.MI). One.

*Production Explosion #1:* A ticker with a structural upward drift during consolidation spends 40% of its consolidation bars between 80–85%. With threshold=85, zero touches are counted. With threshold=80, four are counted. The AI is told this is a "poorly-defined range" and recommends flat. It was a coiled spring.
*Production Explosion #2:* Volatile small-caps on Borsa Italiana routinely whipsaw. A threshold of 85% for a high-ATR ticker means "at resistance" requires the ticker to be within the top 15% of its range — which it may overshoot and immediately reverse from, getting counted as zero touches because the retreat happened in one bar before the state machine could register it.

*Evidence demanded:* A backtest across all tickers in `ticker.xlsx` showing that the distribution of reversal points clusters around 85/15, not 80/20 or 90/10. Or a sensitivity analysis showing that changing these thresholds by ±5pp does not materially change the touch count distribution.

*Verdict:* These must be promoted to config or at minimum have a docstring citation explaining *why* 85/15. "It felt right" is not documented here, but it's the real reason.

---

**Constant #2: `RETREAT_THRESHOLD = 65.0` and `BOUNCE_THRESHOLD = 35.0`**

*What it is:* Lines 55–56. The gray zone boundaries.

*Why? (Layer 1):* These create a 20-point gray zone between the touch entry and exit thresholds. 85→65 for resistance, 15→35 for support.
*Why? (Layer 2):* A 20-point gray zone is 20% of the entire range width. On a 10%-band-width range, this is a 2% price move in absolute relative terms. On a 3%-band-width compressed range (the SCM.MI smoke test ends at 3.1%), the gray zone collapses to 0.6% — which may be inside the bid-ask spread of a thin Italian small-cap. The constants are not scale-aware.
*Why? (Layer 3):* The gray zone width was chosen as a fixed percentage of the range, but the range itself varies by an order of magnitude across the ticker universe (3%–15% from the smoke test data alone). What is a "meaningful retreat" in a wide range is noise in a compressed range.

*Production Explosion #1:* A compressed range (band_width=3%) has an effective gray zone of 0.6% of rclose. A single noisy bar prints at range_pct=64% (one tick below the retreat threshold), ending the touch, then immediately bounces back to 90%. The state machine counts 2 touches. The actual range has 1 resistance level. The setup is assessed as "clean range, 2 touches." It is not.
*Production Explosion #2:* The gray zone is evaluated on `range_position_pct`, not absolute price. When `rhi_20 == rlo_20` (zero-width range), any NaN values skip the state machine silently. An entire consolidation phase with zero-range bars is invisibly dropped from the touch count.

*Evidence demanded:* Sensitivity analysis of touch counts across the full ticker history as band_width_pct varies. The gray zone should probably scale with band_width.

*Verdict:* At minimum, add a warning log when band_width_pct < some threshold indicating the gray zone may be meaningless. Ideally: scale the gray zone as a function of band_width.

---

**Constant #3: `SIDEWAYS_SLOPE_THRESHOLD = 0.15`**

*What it is:* Line 58. The maximum `|slope_pct_per_day|` to be classified as "sideways."

*Why? (Layer 1):* 0.15%/day seems conservative.
*Why? (Layer 2):* 0.15%/day × 40 bars = 6% cumulative drift. Is a range that drifts 6% in one direction genuinely "consolidating"?
*Why? (Layer 3):* This threshold was validated against SCM.MI where `slope = 0.0087%/day`. That's a *perfectly* flat example. There is no test with a slope of 0.14%/day (just under threshold) to verify the classification makes trading sense at the boundary.

*Production Explosion #1:* A stock in a confirmed bearish phase drifts at -0.14%/day during a 40-bar "consolidation" window. `classify_trend` returns `is_sideways=True`. The breakout setup is assessed as valid. The "breakout" is a continuation of the downtrend misclassified as a range.
*Production Explosion #2:* If the benchmark (FTSEMIB.MI) is in a strong trend, a stock with zero absolute drift shows non-zero relative slope. The threshold of 0.15 may have been calibrated only during quiet benchmark periods.

*Evidence demanded:* Distribution of `slope_pct_per_day` across all historical consolidation windows in the dataset, with the 0.15 threshold marked. Is 0.15 the 75th percentile of "real consolidations"? The 90th? Nobody knows.

*Verdict:* Must be in `config.json`. Add a boundary test at 0.14 and 0.16.

---

**Constant #4: `MIN_TREND_BARS = 5`**

*What it is:* Line 59. The minimum bars required for a "reliable" OLS estimate.

*Why? (Layer 1):* 5 bars is the minimum to avoid a degenerate regression.
*Why? (Layer 2):* An OLS fit to 5 noisy financial bars has standard error enormous relative to the 0.15%/day threshold. At typical Borsa Italiana daily volatility (0.5–1.5%), the 95% CI on the slope swamps the threshold.
*Why? (Layer 3):* The comment says "minimum for a reliable OLS estimate." That is a lie. 5 data points does not produce a reliable OLS estimate of anything in a noisy financial series.

*Production Explosion #1:* `assess_range` called on a ticker that just entered consolidation 5 bars ago. OLS on 5 bars gives `slope = 0.14%/day`. The setup is flagged as valid consolidation. The ticker breaks out the next day continuing a trend that never paused.
*Production Explosion #2:* If the zero-run is exactly 5 bars long (brief pause in a trend), `classify_trend` returns without error but with meaningless output, and the range is assessed as if it were a genuine consolidation.

*Evidence demanded:* Monte Carlo simulation showing that OLS slope estimation at 5 bars, given typical Italian equity relative price volatility, produces false "sideways" classification below an acceptable rate.

*Verdict:* Raise to minimum 10. Document the statistical justification.

**Resolution (2026-04-05):** Fixed — `MIN_TREND_BARS` raised from 5 to 10. OLS slope on fewer than 10 bars at typical Borsa Italiana daily volatility (0.5–1.5%) produces a 95% CI on slope that swamps the 0.15%/day `SIDEWAYS_SLOPE_THRESHOLD`, making the classification statistically meaningless. Comment added in source. See action plan item 6.

---

**Constant #5: `COMPRESSION_RANK_THRESHOLD = 25.0`**

*What it is:* Line 61. The percentile below which a range is "historically tight."

*Why? (Layer 1):* Bottom quartile seems reasonable.
*Why? (Layer 2):* Applied uniformly regardless of ticker history length. A new listing with 200 bars has a different distribution than a stock with 2500 bars.
*Why? (Layer 3):* `is_compressed` requires BOTH `slope < 0` (over 40 bars) AND `rank < 25` (over 252 bars). These windows are different lengths and reference different time periods. A range actively narrowing from a historically elevated level would fail the rank test despite being potentially more interesting than a range at a tight level that stopped narrowing.

*Production Explosion #1:* A newly listed stock with 200 bars of history has `band_width_pct_rank` computed on 200 values, not 252. The rank is not comparable to a full-history ticker. `is_compressed=True` means different things for different tickers with no way to detect which case you're in.
*Production Explosion #2:* Rank of 26% (just above threshold): `is_compressed=False` returned. By any practical definition the range is nearly as compressed as 24% would be. Binary threshold on a percentile rank is cliff-edge decision making.

*Evidence demanded:* Show that `rank < 25` produces better out-of-sample breakout predictions than `rank < 30` or `rank < 20`. This has never been backtested.

*Verdict:* Move to config. Add `history_available` and `is_rank_reliable` fields to `VolatilityState`.

---

**Design Felony #1: The `_ols_slope` import alias**

*What it is:* Line 47. `from ta.utils import ols_slope as _ols_slope`.

*Why? (Layer 1):* The underscore prefix signals "private."
*Why? (Layer 2):* The function is imported from a public module. It is not private. The underscore is a lie.
*Why? (Layer 3):* Someone searching for `_ols_slope` will find only the import line. Fifteen minutes wasted per encounter.

*Production Explosion #1:* New engineer assumes `_ols_slope` is defined locally, searches, fails, looks in the wrong module.
*Production Explosion #2:* Linters flagging private member access from outside will produce false alarms that get globally silenced.

*Verdict:* `from ta.utils import ols_slope`. Name it what it is.

---

**Design Felony #2: `assess_range` silently skips unlimited trailing non-zero bars**

*What it is:* Lines 476–478. The backward walk skips any trailing non-zero bars with no upper bound.

*Why? (Layer 1):* Allows calling `assess_range` on the breakout bar itself.
*Why? (Layer 2):* No limit on how many non-zero bars are skipped. 200-bar trend + 5-bar pause = skip 200 bars silently.
*Why? (Layer 3):* The caller catches ValueError and returns `None`. The AI is told "no consolidation = ticker in trend." It is not in a trend. It had a consolidation too brief to analyze. Silent misclassification.

*Production Explosion #1:* A ticker exits a 150-bar trend, consolidates for 4 bars (below MIN_TREND_BARS), breaks out. `assess_range` raises. AI says "no consolidation." The breakout from the 4-bar pause is invisible. Valid signal missed.
*Production Explosion #2:* The backward walk is O(n) Python loop. For 2500-bar histories in batch processing this is a performance cliff.

*Verdict:* Add `max_trend_skip` parameter with a documented default. Log a warning when hit.

---

**Design Felony #3: NaN from zero-range bars silently dropped from touch counting**

*What it is:* Lines 499–502. `rng.where(rng != 0)` produces NaN when `rhi_20 == rlo_20`. NaN is silently skipped by `count_touches`.

*Why? (Layer 1):* Zero-division guarded. NaN handled. Looks correct.
*Why? (Layer 2):* `rhi_20 == rlo_20` signals a trading halt or data error, not a normal gap. Silent skip treats pathological data as ordinary missing data.
*Why? (Layer 3):* If 10 of 40 consolidation bars are halted, touch counts are computed on 30 bars reported as if from 40. No warning. No flag. No way to detect this in the output.

*Production Explosion #1:* Trading halt during consolidation produces NaN for 15 bars. Those bars span 2 resistance touches. Touch count = 0. Range assessed as "poorly-defined." Valid setup missed.
*Production Explosion #2:* After NaN skip, remaining bars fall below MIN_TREND_BARS. ValueError raised. Caller returns None. User told "no consolidation." The ticker was in 40-bar consolidation with a data quality issue.

*Evidence demanded:* Count the frequency of `rng == 0` in the actual parquet. If it occurs once in production, this is a real bug.

*Verdict:* Count and log NaN range_pct values. Raise or return degraded result if NaN count exceeds 10% of window bars.

---

**Control Flow Misdemeanor #1: `.shift()` without RangeIndex guard in `breakout_prior_consolidation_length`**

*What it is:* Lines 257–261. `rbo.shift(1)` and `age.shift(1)` on a Series that may have a DatetimeIndex from the parquet.

*Why? (Layer 1):* `shift(1)` shifts by 1 period. Standard.
*Why? (Layer 2):* On a DatetimeIndex with gaps (holidays, data gaps), `shift(1)` shifts by one calendar unit, not one row. Bars after gaps produce NaN instead of the previous bar's value.
*Why? (Layer 3):* The function says "sorted ascending by date" but does not require RangeIndex. Real parquet data has DatetimeIndex. Italian public holidays create gaps.

*Production Explosion #1:* Italian national holiday creates a gap. `rbo.shift(1)` produces NaN for the post-holiday bar. `is_breakout_flip` evaluates to False. A real breakout flip is missed.
*Production Explosion #2:* `age.shift(1)` produces NaN for the same bar. Consolidation length reported as NaN at the flip bar.

*Verdict:* Add `.reset_index(drop=True)` before operating. Or assert `isinstance(rbo.index, pd.RangeIndex)`.

---

**Control Flow Misdemeanor #2: `measure_volatility_compression` uses `iloc[-history_bars:]` without short-history guard**

*What it is:* Lines 369–370. `bw.iloc[-252:]` silently returns fewer bars for new listings.

*Why? (Layer 1):* Python slicing is permissive with short series.
*Why? (Layer 2):* Percentile rank computed on 100 bars is a different metric than on 252 bars, but both are compared to the same threshold (25.0).
*Why? (Layer 3):* A stock with 5 bars of history passes `MIN_TREND_BARS` check and computes `band_width_pct_rank` on 5 values. The rank is quantized to 20pp steps. `is_compressed` on 5 bars of history is noise dressed as signal.

*Production Explosion #1:* New listing with 200 bars: rank computed on 200 observations, not 252. Not comparable to full-history tickers. The AI receives `is_compressed=True` or `False` with no indication that the signal is based on 200 bars.
*Production Explosion #2:* 5-bar history stock: rank can only be 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, or 100%. `is_compressed=True` requires rank=20% — the absolute minimum of 5 bars. This is nearly random.

*Verdict:* Add `history_available: int` and `is_rank_reliable: bool` to `VolatilityState`. The AI must know when it's operating on thin history.

## The Sentence

**Culpability Score: 6/10**

**Crime Counts:**
- Assumptions (unproven): 5
- Magic constants (unjustified): 5
- Design felonies: 3
- Control flow misdemeanors: 2
- Missing error handling: 2
- Security violations: 0

**Most Dangerous Offense:** `SIDEWAYS_SLOPE_THRESHOLD = 0.15` combined with the unlimited trailing non-zero bar skip in `assess_range`. Together they silently classify a brief pause in an active trend as a valid sideways consolidation — feeding directly into the AI system prompt as a high-quality trading signal, without any warning.

**Rehabilitation Plan (most damning first):**
1. `[x]` Move `SIDEWAYS_SLOPE_THRESHOLD`, `TOUCH_HI_THRESHOLD`, `TOUCH_LO_THRESHOLD`, `COMPRESSION_RANK_THRESHOLD` to `config.json`. → Added full `range_quality` section to `config.json`; `RangeQualityConfig` frozen dataclass with `from_config_file()` classmethod loads all 8 thresholds.
2. `[x]` Add `max_trend_skip` to `assess_range` and log a warning when the backward walk skips more than N non-zero bars. → `assess_range` accepts `config: RangeQualityConfig`; emits `WARNING` when `trend_bars_skipped > config.max_trend_skip` (default 50).
3. `[x]` Add `history_available` and `is_rank_reliable` to `VolatilityState`. → Both fields added; `is_rank_reliable = history_available >= history_bars`; `WARNING` emitted on thin history; propagated through `ask_trader.py` snapshot and `SYSTEM_PROMPT`.
4. `[x]` Guard `breakout_prior_consolidation_length` against non-RangeIndex with `.reset_index(drop=True)`. → `reset_index(drop=True)` applied before all shift operations; holiday gaps no longer produce spurious NaN.
5. `[x]` Count and log NaN `range_pct` values in `assess_range`. → `assess_range` counts NaN `range_pct` bars (caused by zero-width range) and emits `WARNING` when `n_nan / n_window > 0.10`.
6. `[x]` Raise `MIN_TREND_BARS` to 10 with statistical justification. → Raised 5 → 10 with comment: OLS on < 10 bars at typical Borsa Italiana daily volatility (0.5–1.5%) produces 95% CI on slope that swamps the 0.15%/day threshold.
7. `[x]` Remove the `_ols_slope` alias. → `from ta.utils import ols_slope` used directly.

**Open items (raised in charge verdicts, not promoted to formal plan):**
- Sensitivity analysis on `touch_hi/lo` thresholds (85/15) — requires backtest across full ticker universe; no code change possible without empirical distribution data.
- Scale gray zone with `band_width_pct` — the zone collapses to sub-spread width on compressed ranges; flagged, not yet implemented.
- Boundary tests at `slope_pct_per_day = 0.14` and `0.16` — the 0.15%/day `SIDEWAYS_SLOPE_THRESHOLD` has no characterisation test at its decision boundary in `TestClassifyTrend`.

**Final Statement:**
The sentence has been served. All seven structural defects are remediated: the magic constants are in config and observable, the silent degradation paths emit warnings, the thin-history signal is flagged, the DatetimeIndex gap bug is closed, and `MIN_TREND_BARS` is at a defensible minimum. The code now fails loudly instead of silently. The remaining open items require empirical backtest data before they can be addressed in code — they are documented here so the next engineer does not discover them at 3am.
