"""
range_quality.py — Foundational analytical primitives for the range breakout trader.

Public API:

    count_touches(range_pct, ...)
        How many distinct times price approached resistance / support without breaking through.
        Uses range_position_pct thresholds with a state machine so a prolonged approach
        near a level counts as one touch, not many.

    classify_trend(rclose, threshold)
        Whether relative price is moving sideways over a window.
        Uses OLS slope normalised by mean(rclose), expressed as %/day.
        More robust than rclose_chg_Nd which only compares first and last bar.

    breakout_prior_consolidation_length(rbo)  [backtesting utility, not used in snapshot]
        Pre-breakout consolidation length at each historical flip bar.
        For the live snapshot use rbo_N_age from the parquet directly.

    measure_volatility_compression(df, ...)
        Whether the 20-day relative range envelope is actively narrowing.
        Returns a VolatilityState dataclass with band_width_pct, OLS slope,
        historical percentile rank, is_compressed, history_available,
        and is_rank_reliable flags.

    assess_range(df, window_bars, config)
        Integrates all three range-quality primitives into a single RangeSetup snapshot.
        Returns n_resistance/support touches, sideways classification, slope,
        consolidation length, and band width at the last consolidation bar.
        Accepts a RangeQualityConfig for threshold overrides; logs warnings when
        trend-skip limit is exceeded or NaN bars are present.

    RangeQualityConfig
        Dataclass holding all tuneable thresholds. Defaults match config.json
        §range_quality. Load from config with RangeQualityConfig.from_config_file().

All pure functions are:
    - Pure (no I/O, no side-effects).
    - Typed (PEP 484).
    - Independently testable with synthetic pd.Series / pd.DataFrame.
    - Documented with invariants and failure modes.

See range_breakout_trader.md §"Foundational analytical questions" for derivations
and the SCM.MI smoke-test values used in tests/test_range_quality.py.

Threshold provenance

All numeric thresholds originate from config.json §"range_quality". The module-level

    Count distinct resistance and support touch events within a consolidation window.

    A resistance touch event starts when range_pct >= hi_thresh and ends when
    range_pct drops below retreat.  A new touch is only counted after the previous
    one has ended (no double-counting of a prolonged approach).  Support touch events
    are symmetric.

    The gray zones [retreat, hi_thresh) for resistance and (lo_thresh, bounce] for
    support keep the state machine inside the current touch without triggering a new
    count.  This models the real-world pattern where price lingers near a level for
    several bars before finally retreating — which is one touch, not many.

                   >100% or <0% = price outside the range (active breakout).

    """
    Return the pre-breakout consolidation length at each historical breakout flip bar.

    BACKTESTING UTILITY — not used in the live snapshot.

    For the live snapshot, the current consolidation length is simply
    `rbo_N_age` at the last bar (already present in analysis_results.parquet).
    This function is for retrospective analysis: scanning all historical flip bars
    to ask "how long did that consolidation last before it broke out?"

    At the bar where rbo transitions from 0 to a non-zero value (breakout flip),
    this returns the number of consecutive bars that rbo held 0 BEFORE the flip.
    All other bars return NaN.

    Why the shift is necessary:
        rbo_N_age resets to 1 on the flip bar itself. Reading rbo_N_age at the
        breakout bar gives 1, not the consolidation length. This function shifts
        the age series by one to recover the pre-breakout count at the flip bar.

    Args:
        rbo: Breakout signal series (+1 / 0 / -1) for a single ticker, sorted
             ascending by date. Must have a RangeIndex (0, 1, 2, …) — use

    Measure whether the 20-day relative range envelope is actively compressing.

    Computes three independent signals and combines them into a VolatilityState:

    1. band_width_pct = (rhi_20 - rlo_20) / rclose * 100 at the last bar.
       Already normalised for ticker price level — directly comparable across tickers.

    2. band_width_slope = OLS slope of band_width_pct over the last window_bars clean bars.
       Uses ols_slope() from ta.utils — no duplicated math.
       A negative slope means the 20-day envelope is getting tighter bar by bar.

    3. band_width_pct_rank = fraction of the last history_bars values that are <=
       the current band_width_pct, expressed as a percentile (0–100).
       Normalises for ticker-specific volatility.

    is_compressed requires BOTH signals to be true:
       - Actively narrowing (slope < 0): range is in motion toward a breakout.
       - Historically tight (rank < rank_threshold): range is not just quiet, it is
         compressed relative to this ticker's own baseline.

    The new fields history_available and is_rank_reliable allow callers to detect
    when the rank is based on insufficient history (new listings, short backfill).

                        Typically 252 (one trading year). Default 252.
